# assignments
Assignments done throughout Ph. D. course at Yonsei University. Codes may not be perfect according to the description. Reports are available upon request.

### Neural Networks
* `NN_Assignment_1.ipynb` - Drop wave cosine function approximation using linear regression.
* `NN_Assignment_2.ipynb` - CNN training implementation on CIFAR-10 dataset.
* `NN_Assignment2_1.ipynb` - Transfer learning using CIFAR-10 pretrained model on face dataset. Face dataset is in `face.zip`.
* `NN_Assignment2_2.ipynb` - LSTM implementation to predict bitcoin closing price. The dataset is in `btc.csv`.

### Digital Image Processing
* `Homework_1.ipynb` - Image Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in 8x8 blocks, then performing subsampling and interpolation.
* `Homework_2.ipynb` - Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT).
* `Homework_3.ipynb` - Image Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) and Lloyd-Max Quantization. _(Huffman Coding Incomplete)_.
* `Homework_4.ipynb` - Implementation of median filter and FIR filter, specifically using Hamming Window to denoise images with different types of noise.
* `Homework_5.ipynb` - Image Gamma Correction, Histogram Equalization, conversion to YCrCb format.
* `Homework_6.ipynb` - Inverse filter, Wiener filter, constrained matrix inversion filter to deblur cylindrical boundary blurred and Gaussian blurred images.
* `Homework_7.ipynb` - Image segmentation using mean values and Otsu thresholding, object and edge detection using Sobel and Canny filters.

### Random Process
* `llgc.ipynb` - Implementation of Learning with Local and Global Consistency (LLGC) on two-spirals dataset. The LLGC paper is in [this website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/LLGC.pdf), while the code implementation is based on [this Git](https://github.com/provezano/lgc).
